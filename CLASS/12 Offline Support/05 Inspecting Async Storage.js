/*
We will see how we inspect to check the content of our Async Storage...

1.  Enable remote debugging...
2.  Open the React Native Debugger >> In the console, run the function 'showAsyncStorageContentInDev()' >> This shows the content of the AsyncStorage..
3.  You can also work directly with the AsyncStorage by calling its diffrent functions e.g. clear() etc by running the code '$reactNative.AsyncStorage.clear()'
