/*
justifyContent : - We this, we can align items on the main axis (horizontal for flexDirection of row, vertical for flexDirection of column)...
center : - The items will be centered on the horizontal axis if flexDirection is set to row and it will be centered on the vertical axis if flexDirection is set to column

alignItems : - This the opposite of justifyContent. While justifyContent aligns items on the primary axis, alignItems aligns content on the secondary axis.
center : - The items will be centered on the vertical axis if flexDirection is set to row and it will be centered on the horizontal axis if flexDirection is set to column
