/*
You wont be using these properties as much but its good to know them just incase you see them in someone else's code...

flexBasis : - With these we can set the size of an item along the primary axis.. If our primary axis is horizontal, it will set the width, if our primary axis is vertical, it will set the height
flexGrow : 1 : - when we set these on an item, the rest item will be pushed to the far right and the item we set it on will fill the available space, on primary axis of vertical, the other items are pushed to the bottom while dat item we set it on fills the available space
flexShrink : 1 : - If we have multiple items aligned on the primary axis and one of the item overflows to push other items out of the screen, setting flexShrink: 1 will shrink the overflowed item so the other items can fit on the screen
